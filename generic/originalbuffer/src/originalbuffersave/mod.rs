/**
 * SECTION:element-originalbuffersave
 *
 * GStreamer elements to store the original buffer and restore it later
 *
 * In many analysis scenario (for example machine learning), it is desirable to
 * use a pre-processed buffer, for example by lowering the resolution, but we may
 * want to take the output of this analysis, and apply it to the original buffer.
 *
 * These elements do just this, the typical usage would be a pipeline like:
 *
 * `... ! originalbuffersave ! videoconvertscale ! video/x-raw, width=100, height=100 ! analysiselement ! originalbufferrestore ! ...`
 *
 * The originalbufferrestore element will "restore" the buffer that was entered to the "save" element, but will keep any metadata that was added later.
